Paragraph:
After the first sprint, we feel like we need to put more stuffs in backlog to get feedback earlier. Firstly, we need to complete sign-in and sign-up functionality including the front-end and backend to get feedback from our sign-in, sign-up and home page functionality and UI. Secondly, we wanted to implement Security function since we did not got into that a lot during the last sprint. Moreover, we had a few classes created in last sprint that need more functionalities and some improvements on existing functionalities, so we put the task on database and stock api in the backlog as well. These are the stuffs we have decided to develop in order to keep our steady progress on all of the eight features.
